These double helical stacks of transverse subunits are twisted into left-handed ribbon-like filaments that likely incorporate the following proteins: (1) the intermediate filaments: medium- and high-molecular-weight neurofilaments; (2) the microtubule-associated proteins map-2 and tau; (3) actin; and (4) UBIQUITINS. As one of the hallmarks of ALZHEIMER DISEASE, the neurofibrillary tangles eventually occupy the whole of the cytoplasm in certain classes of cell in the neocortex, hippocampus, brain stem, and diencephalon. The number of these tangles, as seen in post mortem histology, correlates with the degree of dementia during life. Some studies suggest that tangle antigens leak into the systemic circulation both in the course of normal aging and in cases of Alzheimer disease. [SEP] intracellular knots or clumps of neurofibrils seen in various parts of the brain in Alzheimer's disease; composed of dense arrays of paired helical filaments (neurofilaments and microtubules) and incorporating the following proteins: intermediate filaments, medium and high molecular weight neurofilaments, microtubule associated proteins, map2 and tau, actin, and ubiquitins.

The antibodies from the primary infection cannot neutralize the virus. Instead, the Ab-virus complexes attach to Fc receptors on circulating monocytes. The antibodies then facilitate more efficient viral infection of monocytes. The outcome is an increase in the overall replication of the virus and a higher risk of disease that is more severe than the initial infection. [SEP] Enhancement of viral infectivity caused by non-neutralizing antibodies. There are at least two mechanisms known to account for this: mediation by Fc receptors (RECEPTORS, FC) or by complement receptors (RECEPTORS, COMPLEMENT). Either the virus is complexed with antiviral IMMUNOGLOBULIN G and binds to Fc receptors, or virus is coated with antiviral IMMUNOGLOBULIN M and binds to complement receptors.

Chromosome Y deletions are a frequent genetic cause of male infertility. The mode of transmission follows a Y-linked pattern, with incomplete penetrance, but as deletions are often associated with infertility, they generally occur de novo. Molecular diagnosis is made by PCR amplification of STS type sequences (sequence-tagged sites) from the AZFa, b, and c regions. All chromosome Y deletions do not necessarily lead to infertility: firstly, some deletions (especially some partial deletions) do not result in spermatogenesis defects; secondly, among men with severe oligospermia, some can father children without infertility treatment. Finally, when mature spermatozoa are found in the sperm or in the testicles, the infertility problem can be solved with medically assisted procreation techniques. However, there is a risk of transmitting the microdeletion to every male infant.

Phenotype can be highly variable, but it primarily has characteristics of significant developmental delay, postnatal growth above the mean, muscular hypotonia and distinctive facial features (such as broad and prominent forehead, hypertelorism, epicanthic folds, ptosis, short philtrum, protruding lips with a full lower lip, high arched palate). Abnormal hypoplastic male genitalia and skeletal abnormalities are frequently present.

The most significant anomaly is a recurring deletion in 5q35.2 comprising the NSD1 gene that causes Sotos syndrome. Subtelomeric deletions of the terminal 3.5 Mb region on 5q35.3 are very rare. Larger deletions including bands 5q35.1, 5q35.2 and 5q35.3 cause a more severe phenotype that associates severe developmental delay with microcephaly and significant cardiac defects. Various combinations of signs may result from deletions of variable extent depending on the genes comprised in the deleted segment.

Normally, there are two pronuclei (2PN), including the paternal pronucleus and the maternal pronucleus, in the zygote after fertilisation. It is generally accepted that multiple pronuclei (MPN) formation is due to the abnormal extrusion of the second polar body or to abnormal fertilisation with multiple sperm. The MPN therefore can cause infertility and recurrent failure of IVF/ICSI. [PMID:26550358, PMID:31704776]
